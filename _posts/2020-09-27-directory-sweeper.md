## Inspiration
My folders are always messy. That's why I decided to program a solution to this problem.

## What it does
When you start the program, it asks for a cluttered directory to organize. Once you click it, it'll immediately begin organizing the directory. It will create an organized folder and within it, it'll have a folder for every file type [Text Files, Video Files, Image Files, etc].

## How I built it
This software was programmed with Python and Qt for Python.

## Challenges I ran into
Not many other than having to manually make long lists of file extension types. 

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
This is a working software that can be used on any platform. I'm proud that this can be used right away by people.

## What I learned
Learned a bit more about the shutil library.

## What's next for Folder Organizer
Maybe I'll make a better user interface and more customizability so users can customize how their folders are organized.
